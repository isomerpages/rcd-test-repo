**Perdita**: I’ll not put
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them,
no more than, were I painted, I would wish
this youth should say ’twere well, and only
therefore desire to breed by me. Here’s flowers for you: hot lavender, mints, savory, marjoram, the marigold, that goes to bed wi’ th’ sun and with him rises weeping. These are flowers of middle summer, and I think they are given to men of middle age. You’re very welcome.
